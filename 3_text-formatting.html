            Dearest Lilly,
            
            Life has been totally different throughout the summer. It almost feels like living in an alternate world. I get good sleep and literally do not have to wake up to finish the morning chores. Everything is kept ready, and I am allowed to eat whatever I want whenever I want to. The place I am staying is incredible. It is by a beach, and I enjoy watching the sunset everyday. The climate is moderate and the surrounding is calm.
            
            Every day, I get a two-wheeler on which I can go around the place. I visit villages and make acquaintances. The people here are really nice and hospitable. I will be here for two more weeks, and I hope they go on as great as the past few weeks have been.
            
            My time here has been exceptionally peaceful and pleasant, and I have been thinking about making this happen every summer. I would love it if you could join me next summer. I am sure you will love it too. Let me know what you think of it.
            
            With lots of love,
            
            Diana
